                                                A chiropractor is a registered healthcare practitioner that cares for

                                                the neuromusculoskeletal system &ndash; the bones, joints, nerves,
                                                muscles, tendons, and ligaments. In South Africa, chiropractors study

                                                A chiropractor is focused on the body&lsquo;s ability to self-heal by
                                                helping to manage pain through the use of adjustments to maintain good
                                                alignment by realigning the joints in the body.<br> Chiropractic
                                                adjustments improve the functioning of other systems throughout the
                                                body.<br>
                                                Chiropractors can help with a multitude of conditions and are used as an
                                                alternative to, or to complement, conventional medicine by keeping
                                                people off medications and away from surgery unless absolutely necessary
                                                and as a last resort.

                                            <h2>How a Chiropractic Adjustment Works</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Chiropractic adjustment is the most common way that Doctors of
                                                Chiropractic treat painful and dysfunctional areas of the spine.
                                                Chiropractic is an art as it is a science.<br>
                                                Our bodies are complex and respond to a variety of external stressors
                                                each day, decreasing our body&lsquo;s ability to function optimally.<br>
                                                Chiropractic adjustments are either a quick movement or slow with
                                                constant pressure.<br>
                                                Even newborns can receive adjustments &ndash; there are techniques
                                                specifically designed for them.<br>
                                                The Chiropractic Adjustment delivers gentle movement into these
                                                restricted joints and tight muscles. By encouraging proper motion, pain
                                                and inflammation are reduced. Patients often experience improved
                                                mobility and decreased pain and muscle tightness with chiropractic
                                                treatments.<br> A “cracking noise” is often heard during an adjustment,
                                                similar to that when opening a can of a cooldrink. These noises are
                                                generated when the gas is released from the joint fluid during quick
                                                distraction of the joint surfaces, and is not harmful to the vertebrae
                                                in any way.<br>
                                                The aim of adjustment is always to normalize spinal functioning and to
                                                remove interference in the nervous system, thus allowing innate healing
                                                abilities to function properly.

                                            <p>
                                                Your first visit will begin with a thorough medical history
                                                assessment.<br> A indepth medical history questionaire needs to be
                                                completed.<br>
                                                A physical examination will include several diagnostic and orthopaedic
                                                tests, checking
                                                posture, muscle strength, arm and leg mobility.<br>If necessary further
                                                investigations or testing, such as
                                                x-rays, blood tests, urine samples, ultrasound, may be required, to
                                                establish if your diagnosis will be suitable for chiropractic
                                                treatment.<br>
                                                During a chiropractic adjustment procedure, you will be asked to lay
                                                face down on a
                                                specially padded chiropractic table, or a drop table, designed with
                                                sections that drop
                                                down when pressure is applied to the back. This enables realignment of
                                                your spine by the
                                                chiropractor using controlled force.<br> During your procedure you will
                                                be positioned in different ways, enabling access to various areas of
                                                your body.<br>
                                                You will be provided with valuable patient education and information
                                                ensuring you to
                                                take good care of your body and spine by good posture while standing,
                                                sleeping, or
                                                sitting at a desk.
