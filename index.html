                                                Chiropractors are trained in the mechanics of the body, to
                                                diagnose,
                                                treat and prevent problems with muscles, joints, ligaments,

                                                Our bodies are complex and respond to a variety of external
                                                stressors every day. Physical and emotional stress both play
                                                a role
                                                in decreasing how our bodies optimal function.

                                                The most common Chiropractic treatment focuses on posture
                                                and
                                                involves
                                                hands-on techniques including soft tissue work,
                                                mobilisations and
                                                adjustments to improve mobility and reduce pain.

                                                As you may already know, the nervous system is the master

                                                of all living cells, tissues and organs.
                                                The spinal column encases the nervous system (spinal cord

                                                roots) and is responsible for its protection.

                                                In short, because the body's innate recuperative powers are

                                            Dry Needling involves the penetration of the skin with fine
                                            thin needles on specific points.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This is achieved by direct manipulation of the needle within
                                            the dysfunctional muscle tissue or trigger points, along the
                                            body&rsquo;s channels or meridians based on a diagnostic and
                                            clinical reasoning.

                                            The goal is to elicit a twitch which in turn stimulates
                                            nerves under the skin. The outcome of this twitch triggers
                                            the release of certain beneficial chemicals that affect the
                                            central nervous system and contributes to the body&rsquo;s
                                            innate ability to heal itself.

                                            The reduced inflammation and relaxation of the muscle
                                            promotes healing from chronic pain and other conditions.

                                            Cupping therapy is an ancient form of alternative medicine
                                            and has been practised by the ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and
                                            Middle Eastern cultures.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            By incorporating this ancient technique. into her practice,
                                            Dr Janique is able to address a broader range of
                                            patient&rsquo;s needs by offering her patients a
                                            comprehensive, holistic approach to healing and pain relief,
                                            enhancing their quality of life.

                                            Cupping is performed by placing suction cups on the skin to
                                            create a vacuum. The vacuum lifts the skin and underlying
                                            tissues upwards, promoting blood circulation and tissue
                                            relaxation.
                                            This suction helps to increase blood flow, release muscle
                                            tension, and promote healing in the affected area.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Dr Janique uses cupping therapy to address a variety of
                                            musculoskeletal issues, including back, neck, joint pain,
                                            and muscle tension.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Promoting blood flow to the affected area, provides the
                                            essential nutrients and oxygen to enable the healing process
                                            and an overall sense of well-being.
                                        </p>

                                            There are several benefits associated with cupping therapy.
                                            Some of these are: improved circulation, pain relief,
                                            relaxation, detoxification and increased mobility.

                                            Kinesio Tape and Dynamic Tape play an important role in
                                            injury rehabilitation and chronic pain reduction. Taping is
                                            often used to enhance athletic performance. However, the use
                                            of taping has an array of other advantages as well and plays
                                            a significant role in the treatment Dr Janique provides.

                                            The tape is used to provide additional support to muscles
                                            during activity, which can help prevent overuse and strain.
                                            It can also aid in recovery post-activity by reducing muscle
                                            fatigue and soreness.

                                            Dr Janique addresses her patient&rsquo;s injury or physical
                                            condition by utilising her knowledge and proficiency in
                                            human anatomy, muscle function, and biomechanics. Her

                                            patterns and directions are determined by the

                                            being addressed hence facilitating the body&rsquo;s natural
                                            healing process by increasing blood flow and lymphatic
                                            drainage.

                                            This specialised taping method addresses musculoskeletal
                                            issues, offering considerable benefits in muscle function
                                            improvement, pain reduction and overall patient recovery.
                                            The Kinesio Tape application also helps when applied over
                                            inflamed or swollen areas .The tape increases blood
                                            circulation, which reduces swelling, accelerates healing,
                                            and helps alleviate pain.

                                            The tape provides ongoing sensory stimulation that helps the
                                            nervous system, by diminishing pain. It&rsquo;s also used to
                                            correct posture and alignment issues by retraining muscles
                                            and joints to assume their proper positions.

                                            Taping&rsquo;s unique design properties allow it to mimic
                                            the elasticity of human skin, providing support and
                                            stability to muscles and joints without restricting the
                                            body&rsquo;s range of motion enhancing natural healing.

                                            Massage is most commonly thought of as a tool to help
                                            alleviate stress and tension and relieve tired and achy
                                            muscles.

                                            Massage assists in imbalances in soft tissue caused by
                                            strenuous physical activities, incorrect posture or overuse
                                            of certain muscles. However, a massage can prove to be most
                                            useful before and after exercises, in keeping you active and
                                            improving your flexibility and preventing any injuries.

                                            Massage is effective for muscle aches and pains from sitting
                                            at a desk all day, rehabilitation following an injury,
                                            post-surgery or simply to assist athletes performance by
                                            preparing their bodies for a sporting challenge and help
                                            afterwards with the recovery and rehabilitation phase.

                                            Massage also compliments other treatments enhancing the

                                            massage is a deep, invigorating massage and stretching
                                            treatment which focuses on the muscles and soft tissues of
                                            the body.

                                            merits the best results.

                                            Utilising the same principles as the Graston technique,
                                            FAKTR utilises instruments that stimulate the soft tissue to
                                            react and rebuild while in static, active and resistive
                                            positions.

                                            FAKTR is a comprehensive chiropractic rehabilitation method.
                                            It is actually a concept, not a technique. FAKTR treatment
                                            consists of a number of treatments and modalities.

                                            One of the reasons why it&rsquo;s so popular is due to the
                                            methods
                                            used. Specifically catering to each patient&rsquo;s injury,
                                            or the
                                            condition in question by using different techniques and
                                            movement protocols to create a treatment plan unique to
                                            their specific problem.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Patients with soft tissue injuries, like muscle strains,
                                            sprains, and tendon and ligament issues, either acute or
                                            chronic, will find great success with FAKTR.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            While FAKTR is a great way to treat athletes quickly, the
                                            concept can be applied to all ages and all body types.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            FAKTR is excellent for those involved in auto accidents,
                                            work related injuries, sports injuries, shin-splints,
                                            post-surgical recovery including joint replacement and
                                            conditions of daily living. The list goes on and on.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            FAKTR uses a number of different techniques and movement
                                            protocols to create a treatment plan unique to the problem,
                                            injury, and patient. The underlying philosophy uses muscle
                                            movements, exercises, and treatments to restore mobility and
                                            reduce pain.

                                            With the use of small metal instruments Dr Janique will
                                            massage and free up restricted tissues in your problematic
                                            area. This is done by breaking down scar tissue and
                                            promoting blood flow to the area. This helps to aid and
                                            improve movement, reduce pain and stiffness and speed up
                                            your healing process reducing your risk of further injury
                                            later on.

                                            In short, FAKTR, like all Chiropractic treatments, is
                                            another method that is safe and effective in treating common
                                            musculoskeletal complaints and or conditions without the use
                                            of medication.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Not only does this help patients during the healing process,
                                            but it also leads to overall healing, leaving the problem
                                            area strong once recovery is achieved.
